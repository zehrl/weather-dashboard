## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a static site that utilizes the Open Weather API to pull weather data for a given city. The user can search and view a forecast for the current day and 5-days in the future. A search history, utilizing local storage, is visible under the search bar & updated each time the user successfully searches a city.

---

## Instructions

1. Begin by entering a city name into the search bar. You must add the country next to the city if it's outside of the US (Ex. Rome, IT)
2. Submit the search and wait for the content to load.
3. All data displays on the cards. The UV Index will update colors based on the severity for the day. (green = < 3, yellow = < 6, orange = < 8, red = < 11, purple = > 11)
